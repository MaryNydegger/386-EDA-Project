# Car Data Compilation Project

### Project Goals
* The aim of this project is to compile datasets related to automobiles. This involves gathering information on car prices (MSRP - Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) and mapping each car brand to its respective country of origin.

### Question
* How does the country of origin influence car pricing and market preferences?
* This question lead me to viewing other features of cars, like how the MPG changed with different features.

### Included Datasets
* *MSRP Dataset*: The MSRP dataset contains details of various car models, including pricing information and specifications. This dataset is crucial for understanding the suggested retail prices across different vehicle types. (Found at this website `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset`)

* *Car Brands - Country of Origin Dataset*: This dataset correlates car brands with their respective countries of origin. It provides insight into the global representation of different automotive manufacturers. (Found at this website `https://www.canstarblue.com.au/vehicles/car-country-of-origin/`)

### Repository Contents
I have three csv files. One contains the dataset I downloaded from kaggle, the other contains the data that I webscraped, and the other is the dataset that I created from combining these datasets. 
I have one .ipynb file. This is the python code I used to clean the data as well as do the EDA. 
I have one .py file. This is for my streamlit app. The requirements.txt also goes along with this in providing the necessary packages needed to build the app.
I have one Feedback file. This contains feedback from classmates on different parts of the project. This can show you some of the things I started out with and how they helped me to improve it.
