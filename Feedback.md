# EDA Project Feedback

### Part 1 - Choose a Topic
* *Nate L*: I think that's a really solid idea. It seems like it will be pretty straightforward to make a dataset based on that question that fits all the criteria for a tier 1 project.

* *Evan Miller*: Your idea is looking good. I think it would be helpful to dive into a few extra fetures outside of just MSRP and fuel efficiency. Maybe look at the car size with the separate models in the countries as well. Overall i think it is looking really promising and meets the tier 1 criteria. 

* *Tyler Smith*: Similar to Evan's, I think it would be good to add some more features! But overall I love the idea and your motivation behind it. 


### Part 2 - Data Collection
* *Isaac Aguilar*: For your Data Compilation Blog I loved the the Idea for the Table of Content. I liked that you bolded your main question (that's a great idea). For the third paragraph under Overview. You might have wanted to say "linked" not "liked". Clever idea to use Kaggle. Your overall blog is easy to understand and straightforward. I also liked how you numbered your Ethical Considerations.
  
* *Orion*: Same as Isaac mentioned, P3 in Overview has "liked" rather than "linked"
I liked that you described why you went with the two sources you did. It might have been cool to hear a sentence or two about why you didn't choose other sources.
These sentences in Data Cleaning didn't make a ton of sense to me as I read through your post: "Web scraping from the country website took. And then on the other hand, consistency in the country of origin dataframe."
Your pictures didn't show up for me (I was on Eduroam if that affects anything?)
It looks like you forgot to put in the link for your next post in Conclusion, but I'd also add a link to it when you reference it in Data Building
Overall, simple language and easy to follow for someone who doesn't know anything about cars 

* *Tyler Smith*: This dataset correlates car brands with their respective countries of origin. It provides insight into the global representation of different automotive manufacturers. (Found at this website `https://www.canstarblue.com.au/vehicles/car-country-of-origin/`)


### Part 3
* *Orion*: I like sunflowers as much as the next guy, but it may be fun to have a different picture for this blog post since the last 3 posts have the same image. Edit: It looks like it randomly generates a picture when you click on a blog post, which is sweet, but it looks like it back populates those to the other posts as well on the home page.
Your Data Analysis post is set in November, but the Data Cleaning post is set in December. Did you do them in that order?
It felt like the synopsis was a little more flowery and hard to unpack than your previous post. I might break it into more sentences to make reading flow better.
There are a few typos in your first paragraph of EDA you may want to look over. Also, none of the images are working for me here either. What made images show up on my blog (but not on VSC's markdown previewer) was using this for the image link
({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/goodgames/coolGraphPictureWithTooLongOfAName.png)
I personally prefer having the label for a graph ("Graph X.Y") after the image rather than before it. Maybe that's what math textbooks have conditioned me with.
Similar to the introduction, the conclusion felt too dense to read super easily. I'd like to see less generael statements and more specific takeaways you got from your project (like how much to sell your car for)

### Part 4
* *Orion*: Your dashboard had an error when I tried to load it. I'm guessing it's an issue with importing plotly, but I don't know how to solve it, sorry.
